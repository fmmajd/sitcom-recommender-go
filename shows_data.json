  "Description": "Critically lauded for revitalizing the television sitcom, \"Modern Family\" is also quickly cementing itself as a culturally defining series. The recipient of four consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Television Series, \"Modern Family\" returns to the ABC Television Network for its fifth season.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe Pritchett-Dunphy-Tucker clan is a wonderfully large and blended family with Jay Pritchett sitting at the head. By his side is his young, vivacious second wife Gloria, who resists his old-fashioned ways -- an impulse that will become all the more interesting now that he and Gloria have a new baby of their own. This exciting addition will bring more adventures to the family just as Gloria's son, Manny, is about to embark on an adventure of his own as he enters high school. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, also have their son, Luke, heading to high school; their middle daughter, Alex, is full steam ahead on the college track, and the eldest, Haley, is back home figuring out her future. With the kids all growing up, this new chapter means Claire can explore returning to the workforce, which will have its fair share of missteps and victories. And this will be a big year for Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, who alongside his loving partner, Cameron, and daughter Lily, will have a lot of reasons to celebrate. Together these three families give us an honest and often hilarious look into the sometimes warm, sometimes twisted, embrace of the modern family.",

  "Description": "Leonard and Sheldon are brilliant physicists - geniuses in the laboratory, but socially challenged everywhere else. Enter beautiful, street-smart neighbor, Penny, who aims to teach them a thing or two about life. Despite their on-again, off-again relationship in the past, Leonard believes he's found true love with Penny. Even Sheldon has found a female companion, entering into a \"Relationship Agreement\" with neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler. In their free time, Leonard and Sheldon continue to enjoy frequent trips to the comic book store and fantasy role-playing games with their ever-expanding universe of friends, including fellow scientists Koothrappali, Wolowitz and Wolowitz's adorable microbiologist wife, Bernadette.",

  "Description": "A mockumentary about life in a mid-sized suboffice paper merchants in a bleak British industrial town, where manager David Brent thinks he's the coolest, funniest, and most popular boss ever. He isn't. That doesn't stop him from embarrassing himself in front of the cameras on a regular basis, whether from his political sermonizing, his stand-up 'comedy', or his incredibly unique dancing. Meanwhile, long-suffering Tim longs after Dawn the engaged receptionist and keeps himself sane by playing childish practical jokes on his insufferable, army-obsessed deskmate Gareth. Will the Slough office be closed? Will the BBC give David a game show? Will Tim and Dawn end up with each other? And more importantly, will Gareth realize what a hopeless prat he is?",

  "Description": "Charlie is a well-to-do bachelor with a house at the beach, a Jaguar in the front, and an easy way with women. His casual Malibu lifestyle is interrupted when his tightly wound brother Alan, who's facing a divorce, and his son Jake, come to live with him. Together, these two and a half men confront the challenges of growing up; finally. Complicating matters are the brothers' self-obsessed, controlling mother, Evelyn, Alan's estranged wife, Judith and Charlie's crazy neighbor Rose, who wants to be a part of his life and is willing to do anything to be around. After the death of his brother, Alan Harper meets and befriends a lonely young man named Walden Schmidt who turns out to be a billionaire. Unable to afford his brother's home, Alan sells Walden the house, and as a way of showing his gratitude, Walden allows Alan and his son Jake to move in with him.",

 "Young Sheldon": {
  "Name": "Young Sheldon",
  "Description": "For 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper, it isn't easy growing up in East Texas. Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd 9-year-old brother. Finally, there's Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, who sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. For 10 years on \u003ci\u003eThe Big Bang Theory\u003c/i\u003e, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy gives us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.",
